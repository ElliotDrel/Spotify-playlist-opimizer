This code optimizes playlists by managing song ratings. Songs start with a rating of 0, increasing by 1.1 when listened to or 2 when skipped. Songs are removed if their rating hits 6, logged in a separate file. Resetting ratings to 0 ensures freshness. Feedback and suggestions are welcome for future enhancements.
